    "1) At time *t*, The *agent* observes the environment *state* *s<sub>t</sub>* (the Tic-Tac-Toe board).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) From the set of available actions (the open squares), the agent takes *action* *a<sub>t</sub>* (the move giving the highest-scoring board). \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The environment updates at the next *timestep* *t+1* to a new state *s<sub>t+1</sub>*. In Tic-Tac-Toe this is the board resulting from the opponent's move. In a complex environment like a car on a road, the new state may be partly determined by the agent's actions (you turned left and accelerated) and partly by visible or hidden complexities in the environment (a dog runs into the road). And the new state may not be deterministic, it may be stochastic, where some things occur randomly with probabilities dependent on the visible and hidden state and the actions of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The environment generates a *reward*. In Tic-Tac-Toe you get a reward when you win, lose, or draw. In Space Invaders, you win points at various times when you hit different targets. When training a self-driving car, machine learning engineers have to design rewards for staying on the road, getting to the destination, including negative rewards for e.g. collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The technical name for this environment is a [Markov Decision Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process) (MDP). Reinforcement learning always has states, actions, transitions between states, rewards, and an agent that chooses actions, using a cycle of observing the state, acting, getting a reward and repeating with a new state. \n"

    "The agent always has a *policy function*, which chooses the best action based on the environment state. It *may* have the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Model* - An internal representation of the environment. Our agent stores the board and it knows some state-action pairs result in the same state as other state-action pairs. Therefore it can be considered *model-based* (although it doesn't model the full MDP with all transition probabilities). Other agents are *model-free*. They choose actions without explicitly storing an internal model of the state or modeling state transitions. The understanding of the environment is implicit in the policy function (footnote. for instance if instead of a table with all possible Tic-Tac_Toe boards we used a table mapping (boards, action) pairs to values. Then we wouldn't be modeling internally what happens after a move, i.e. several (board, action) pairs arrive at the same board. We would just evaluate state, action pairs directly without an internal model. That would work too, just take longer to train since it would be a bigger table.).\n",

    "\n",
    "In a [previous post](https://alphaarchitect.com/2017/09/27/machine-learning-investors-primer/) we discussed types of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning: Any algorithm that predicts labeled data. Regression predicts a continuous response variable (next quarter's real GDP growth, next month's stock return).  Classification predicts a categorical response variable (recession or recovery, next month's return quintile). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning: Any algorithm that summarizes or learns about unlabeled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every data set is either labeled or unlabeled, right? Between supervised and unsupervised, that must cover everything, right? It's like those two books, [What They Teach You At Harvard Business School](https://www.amazon.com/What-Teach-Harvard-Business-School/dp/0141037865) and [What They Don't Teach You At Harvard Business School](https://www.amazon.com/What-Teach-Harvard-Business-School/dp/0553345834), they must cover all human knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless reinforcement learning is considered the third major machine learning paradigm. Consider the tic-tac-toe robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent doesn't have fixed training data, it discovers data via an unsupervised process and learns a policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rewards can be viewed as labels generated by a supervisor. But rewards aren't directly related to any specific prediction or action. If the agent shoots a target in Space Invaders, it has to figure out which action or actions possibly many timesteps earlier contributed to the reward (the credit assigment problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent's interactions with the environment *shape* that environment and generate a *feedback loop*. A Space Invaders agent changes the world by shooting targets; a self-driving car doesn't modify the road, but its presence and behavior modify how other vehicles behave, and what environment the algorithm encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In supervised learning, the algorithm optimizes model parameters over training data to minimize an error, like mean squared error or cross-entropy. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm optimizes the model parameters over the state space it encounters, and maximizes the expected cumulative reward generated by the Markov Decision Process (MDP) over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I view reinforcement learning as meta-supervised-learning. It's the application of supervised machine learning to [*optimal control*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control). We learn behavior policies to maximize reward in a complex dynamic environment which may also have random and hidden elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many disciplines have encountered these problems in various forms and developed methodologies to solve them: \n",

    "- Neuroscience: The brain's chemical reward loop, how children learn to walk and talk, or catch a ball\n",
    "- Mathematics: Control theory, game theory, optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "In a trading context, optimal control is how we use a market signal to create trading strategy. \n",

Suppose your prediction model gets all of those extreme days right. With 51% accuracy you doubled your return. Suppose you get 51% evenly distributed, you get a tiny increment.\n",
