    "\n",
    "2) From the set of available actions (the open board squares), the agent takes *action* *a<sub>t</sub>* (the best move). \n",
    "\n",
    "3) The environment updates at the next *timestep* *t+1* to a new state *s<sub>t+1</sub>*. In Tic-Tac-Toe this is the board resulting from the opponent's move. In a complex environment like a car on a road, the new state may be partly determined by the agent's actions (you turned left and accelerated) and partly by visible or hidden complexities in the environment (a dog runs into the road). And the new state may not be deterministic, it may be stochastic, where some things occur randomly with probabilities dependent on the visible and hidden state and the actions of the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The environment generates a *reward*. In Tic-Tac-Toe you get a reward when you win, lose, or draw. In Space Invaders, you win points at various times when you hit different targets. When training a self-driving car, machine learning engineers design rewards for staying on the road, getting to the destination, including negative rewards for e.g. collisions.\n",

Therefore it could be considered *model-based*. A fully model-based algorithm explcitly models the full MDP with all transition probabilities, which this Tic-Tac-Toe algorithm doesn't do. Other agents may be *model-free*. They choose actions without explicitly storing an internal model of the state or modeling state transitions. The understanding of the environment is implicit in the policy function.\n",

Then we wouldn't be modeling internally what happens after a move, i.e. several (board, action) pairs arrive at the same board. We would just evaluate state, action pairs directly without any internal model. That would work pretty much the same, it would just be a bigger table and take longer to train.).\n",

    "\n",
    "In a [previous post](https://alphaarchitect.com/2017/09/27/machine-learning-investors-primer/) we discussed the difference between paradigms of machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised learning:* Any algorithm that predicts labeled data. Regression predicts a continuous response variable (next quarter's real GDP growth, next month's stock return).  Classification predicts a categorical response variable (recession or recovery, next month's return quintile). \n",
    "\n",
    "*Unsupervised learning:* Any algorithm that summarizes or learns about unlabeled data, such as clustering or dimensionality reduction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every data set is either labeled or unlabeled, so between supervised and unsupervised, that must cover everything, right? It's like those two books, [What They Teach You At Harvard Business School](https://www.amazon.com/What-Teach-Harvard-Business-School/dp/0141037865) and [What They Don't Teach You At Harvard Business School](https://www.amazon.com/What-Teach-Harvard-Business-School/dp/0553345834). Between the two of them, they must cover all human knowledge, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless reinforcement learning is considered the third major machine learning paradigm. Consider the Tic-Tac-Toe robot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent doesn't have fixed training data, it discovers data via an unsupervised process and learns a policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The rewards can be viewed as labels generated by a supervisor. But rewards aren't always directly related to one specific prediction or action. If the agent shoots a target in Space Invaders, it has to figure out which action or sequence of actions possibly many timesteps earlier contributed to the reward (the *credit assigment* problem). \n",
    "\n",
    "- The agent's interactions with the environment *shape* that environment, help determine what data the learning algorithm subsequently encounters, and generate a *feedback loop*. A Space Invaders agent changes the world by shooting targets; a self-driving car doesn't modify the road, but its presence and behavior modify how other vehicles behave, and what environment the algorithm encounters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In supervised learning, the algorithm optimizes model parameters over training data to minimize a loss function, like mean squared error or cross-entropy. In reinforcement learning, the algorithm optimizes model parameters over the state space it encounters, to maximize the expected reward generated by the Markov Decision Process (MDP) over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning, we move beyond *prediction* to *control*. Reinforcement learning could be viewed as meta-supervised-learning. It's the application of supervised machine learning to [*optimal control*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control).  We apply supervised prediction methods such as classification and regression. But we use them to predict the best action to take within the *action space*. We use supervised methods to choose actions, and learn behavior policies to maximize reward in a complex dynamic environment.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We run an episode.\n",
    "- We back up from the final timestep to the beginning using observed rewards to compute discounted rewards over the full episode.\n",
    "- We train by ascending the theta gradient that improves standardized rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "A self-driving car algorithm doesn't have short episodes like a trading day, so we can't easily do that. An alternative is temporal difference learning (TD):\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use a value function which estimates the expected future reward from this state, following the current policy.\n",
    "- We run one timestep\n",
    "- We back up one episode and compute the difference between the expected value we saw at the last timestep and the value after we took this action (the reward from this action, plus the discounted current expected value)\n",
    "- This improvement is *advantage*, and we train by ascending the theta gradient that improves the probability of the most advantaged actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is actually a slightly strange magical recursive loop, because at the outset our policy has random thetas. So we are training on the improvement from our fairly random value to the slightly less random value at the next timestep where we know one reward. Nevertheless, as we do this many, many times, the influence of rewards further in the future filters back one step at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train on the improvement using our policy between now and the next step, it's called TD(0). We can also train on the improvement 2 steps into the future, and that's TD(1), and we can do TD(2) and so on. If we do TD(&infin;) we are projecting through the end of the episode, however long it may be, and we are back to Monte Carlo learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there's a temporal difference mode known as TD(&lambda;) where we effectively use an exponential moving average of all the TD terms. Setting &lambda; to 0 is effectively TD(0), setting &lambda; to 1 is effectively Monte Carlo, and calibrating &lambda; determines how far into the future we want to peek.\n",

    "#### Revisiting value-based v. policy-based methods\n",
    "\n",
    "If we do TD learning with only a state-value neural network function approximator, and our policy is to choose the action resulting in the best state-value, this is called Deep Q Learning (DQN). If we use a value function and a policy function, and train the policy function separately so that it improves the value function as much as possible, this is actor-critic learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The exploration vs. exploration tradeoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we do Q learning, our policy is to choose the action with the best resulting state-value. However there is a strong possibility that early in our training one action is always best in some part of the state space. So, since we never try the other actions, our training never surfaces situations where they may be better. \n",

    "To avoid this, we do what is called &epsilon;-greedy exploration. Early on, we follow our policy say 60% of the time, and a random action 40% of the time. This allows us to search the whole action space. 40% is the &epsilon; parameter. In practice since our policy network is random at the beginning, we typically start with &epsilon; at 100% and gradually reduce it to a very small value. \n",

    "#### On-policy vs. off-policy learning\n",
    "\n",
    "&epsilon;-greedy algorithms are 'off-policy' learning since they sometimes act differently from the policy and train on the resulting outcomes, in contrast to algorithms where you only take 'on-policy' actions. Policy gradient algorithms sample actions from a probability distribution. Bad actions never have a strictly zero probability, they just get reduced over time, so they implicitly trade off exploration of new actions, vs. exploitation of the best known actions.\n",

    "#### TRPO and PPO, or how to avoid falling off a cliff\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have noticed that sometimes training will fall off a cliff. Through the beauty of extreme nonlinearity of neural networks, a small gradient descent update may generate a large change in the policy outcomes. Sometimes the policy is much worse and has trouble climbing back up. One could avoid that with very small steps, i.e. a small learning rate, but then training takes forever. Two popular variations that address this issue are Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Essentially they avoid or penalize updates which change the output policy too much in one update.\n",

    "\n",
    "Like the man in the MoliÃ¨re play who discovers he's been speaking in prose his whole life, you may have been doing reinforcement learning and optimal control your whole life without realizing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning bridges the gap between prediction and trading. Sometimes one may find that a very small predictive R-squared can lead to high returns. Hypothetically, suppose you have a stock market that yields a 5% return. And the single best day each year is up 5%. Suppose your predictive algorithm always gets that one day right, and is random the rest of the time. With a fraction of a percent increase in R-squared you almost doubled your expected return. On the other hand, a 1-day-per-year improvement in forecasting an up vs. down day, evenly distributed, gives a smaller improvement (the difference between EV|up-day - EV(all days)).\n",
    "\n",
    "How is reinforcement learning different from backtesting? Backtesting exhaustively searches a parameter space for a parameter vector that gives best out-of-sample performance. When we use reinforcement learning with a neural network and gradient descent, we can use much more complex models where there are too many parameter combinations to backtest, and still get a good parameter vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training big models end-to-end simulataneously for prediction and control results in complex emergent behavior that can display almost human-seeming intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, reinforcement learning works in an inherently online fashion, as opposed to approaches like walk-forward time-based cross-validation that iteratively fit and test models out-of-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few issues with reinforcement learning ([further discussion](https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html\n",
    ")):\n",
    "\n",
    "  - RL is very data-hungry or sample-inefficient, more suited to intraday trading.\n",
    "  - High model complexity makes interpretability challenging.\n",
    "  - RL can get stuck at local optima/fall off a cliff. You may have to take special care to not just train on recent experience but also important but rare special cases, the way pilots train for equipment failure and upset recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a parallel between reinforcement learning and the [adaptive market hypothesis](https://alo.mit.edu/book/adaptive-markets/) of [Andrew Lo](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2017/12/18/the-adaptive-markets-hypothesis-a-financial-ecosystems-survival-guide/). Markets may not be perfectly efficient at all times, but they tend to move in that direction via an evolutionary learning process based on experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "JPMorgan and others have reported using RL to trade in the real world, see for instance this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03042.pdf) and more readable [article](https://informaconnect.com/the-latest-in-loxm-and-why-we-shouldnt-be-using-single-stock-algos/). \n",
    "\n",
    "AI algorithms can sometimes be exploited. An adversarial sticker can make image recognition think [a banana is a toaster](https://medium.com/deep-learning-cafe/neural-networks-easily-fooled-e19bf575b527) or an adversarial temporary tattoo can [defeat face recognition](https://cvdazzle.com/). This may be a problem for trading with reinforcement learning. If a market maker algorithm trades on patterns, adversarial algorithms can learn to front-run it or paint the tape to make it do bad trades. But over time the algorithms should adapt to each other and arrive at a new, more efficient price equilibrium. (Or create mad algorithm-induced oscillations? We can't necessarily know.)\n",

    "I'm not sure self-driving vehicles on the streets of New York or New Delhi are likely in the near future, without changes like protected lanes for self-driving vehicles. If pedestrians know that the other driver is always going to stop for them no matter what, they will learn to just cross at the red light, never mind traffic. They can even wear a stop sign on a T-shirt. It's not a matter of how good the self-driving technology is, it's a question of game theory. Knowing that the other driver is a fallible human who at best may be angry and honk and give you the finger, and at worst may be on a cell phone and not even see you tends to concentrate the mind. \n",

    "Nevertheless, anecdotally, poker bots seem to be taking over small-stakes online poker, and it seems like a safe bet reinforcement learning will be increasingly adopted in financial markets. Controversial statement alert: short-term technical traders who look for setups lasting minutes to hours will be no match for algos that adapt quickly to patterns across all markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a need to combine brute force RL with models that understand real-world finance and economics, as chess algorithms and AlphaGo and AlphaZero have model the games.\n",
