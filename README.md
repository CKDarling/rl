Notebooks and code for Alpha Architect post on reinforcement learning.

- Tic-Tac-Toe.ipynb - table-based reinforcement learning to play Tic-Tac-Toe, and analogous if pointless deep learning algo
- Cart-Pole.ipynb - building deep RL algos from scratch with Keras for OpenAI environments like Cartpole and LunarLander. 
  - DQN
  - Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
  - REINFORCE with baseline
  - Run CartPole.ipynb, Run LunarLander.ipynb - only run saved good models, don't train
- Ray_tune.ipynb - similar but with state of the art RL from UC-Berkeley Ray project
- Trading with RL.ipynb - algos to trade fake market data, inspired by Gordon Ritter paper Machine Learning for Trading
